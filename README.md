# Medicare DevOps Platform 🚀
_A cloud-native DevOps platform for multi-environment Kubernetes application delivery on GCP._

## 📌 Project Overview

**Key Highlights:**
- Multi-environment infrastructure provisioning with **Terraform modules** (Staging & Production GKE clusters)
- End-to-end CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions** deploying **Helm-based applications** to GKE
- Secrets managed dynamically using **Google Secret Manager**
- Observability stack: **Prometheus metrics**, **Grafana dashboards**, **PrometheusRule alerts as code**
- GitOps continuous deployment via **Argo CD** with auto-sync and rollback automation
- CIS-compliant Linux server hardening and zero-touch provisioning with **Ansible**
- **Python scripts** to manage auto-scaling, storage lifecycle, and event-driven health checks via **Pub/Sub**
